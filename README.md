LinkedList Using Iterator
=========================

Simple Linked List Implementation showing the implementation of Iterable and Iterator interfaces

Linked List with the basic implementation to add any type of elements. Yet to add more features.


Can use method iterator() for the linked list to traverse using new for loop like a standard collection implementation



Contact me through email for your suggestions to improve the design or to add any features
